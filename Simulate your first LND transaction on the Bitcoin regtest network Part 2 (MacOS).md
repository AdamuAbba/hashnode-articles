# üìúObjective

The goal of this article is to help you

- confirm that we have the correct bitcoin.conf settings
- spin up a Bitcoin network (regtest network)
- spin up a lightening network
- create or unlock a lightening wallet
- send some Bitcoin to one lightning node (to be used for payment later on)
- connect the lightning nodes to form a peer
- open a payment channel between two lightning nodes
- create an invoice from one node
- initiate fulfillment of invoice (transaction) from the second node
- kill both lightning and the Bitcoin network after the transaction

## üìú Introduction

Welcome back fellow Bitcoin/lightning developer I know you're itching for some action...

This is the second part of a two-part series and in case you haven't already read the first part go over here [Part 1](https://hashnode.com/post/clsctrvcp00000ale7n0pfur8)so you can fully maximize this second part.

## üìú Some boring but very important stuff to get us started

There are two nuggets I would like you to keep in mind.

- First nugget: keep in mind that the Lightning Network is a second-layer protocol built on top of the `Bitcoin blockchain` and it enables faster and cheaper transactions by creating off-chain payment `channels` between `users`. These `channels` allow multiple transactions to occur without needing to be recorded on the main `Bitcoin blockchain`. Instead, only the opening and closing `transactions` of the channel are settled on the `blockchain`.

- Second nugget: the Regtest (regression test) Bitcoin network mode creates a `local private blockchain` where you can adjust the parameters to what you want.

According to our nuggets above, we understand that we need to run our lightning network on top of an active Bitcoin network running a local private blockchain (regtest)

**The easy part:**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Confirming our Bitcoin environment and spinning up a Bitcoin network\*\*

To confirm that our settings are correct to spin up the required Bitcoin network, open up the autogenerated `bitcoin.conf` located at `/Users/user/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` with a text editor

```zsh

nvim /Users/user/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf

```

Output:

```zsh

# Daemon Options
server=1
daemon=1
fallbackfee=0.00072
txindex=1
mintxfee=0.0001
txconfirmtarget=6

# Network Options
regtest=1
#signet=1
#testnet=1

[regtest]
# RPC Options
rpcport=18443
rpcuser=bitcoin
rpcpassword=bitcoin

# ZMQ Options
zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28333
zmqpubhashtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
zmqpubhashblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332

```

## üìú Conclusion\*\*

just like catching lightning in a bottle, the key is to strike while the wallet's hot! Stay charged and keep those transactions lightning-fast. thanks for following the series and see you in the next one
